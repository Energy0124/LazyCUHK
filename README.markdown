##Workflow
Hereâ€™s the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

**Keep this in mind: The `master` branch is for deployment only.  Branch off from the `develop` branch to start your awesome work.  Fetch and rebase the `upstream/develop` branch before pull request. **


1. Fork the project
2. Clone your fork

		git clone https://github.com/<yourName>/LazyCUHK.git
3. Configure remote

		git remote add upstream https://github.com/TangRufus/LazyCUHK.git
		git branch develop upstream/develop
4. Create a descriptively named branch, branch off from the develop branch, to contain your change 

		git checkout -b my_awesome_feature develop
5. Hack away
6. Stay updated

		git fetch upstream
		git checkout develop
		git merge upstream/develop
		git push origin develop
7. Rebase

		git checkout my_awesome_feature
		git git merge develop
   If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without bugs
8. Push the branch up to your own copy of fork

		git push origin my_awesome_feature

9. Create an Pull Request with a description and link to your `my_awesome_feature`branch
10. You have done so much.  Leave the hard work to me.  Enjoy being lazy.
